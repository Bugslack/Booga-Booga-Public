- (1) ItemData
ItemData is a Lua "array" which contains the name (key) of every object and its info (that key's "value"). ItemData is non-comprehensive and messy, so to review propositions made through Pull Requests, using Github's text Comparison tool is highly advised. You can search a page for a specific item by pressing Ctrl+F on your browser.
